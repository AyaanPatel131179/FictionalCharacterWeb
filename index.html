    <h1 class="part1">Jon Snow</h1>
    <p class="description">Jon Snow, initially believed to be the illegitimate son (bastard) of Eddard Stark, the Lord of Winterfell, and raised at Winterfell alongside his legitimate children, has a more complex family background. His true parentage is revealed to be far more significant than first assumed. Jon is the son of Lyanna Stark, Eddard's younger sister, and Rhaegar Targaryen, the crown prince of the Targaryen dynasty. This makes Jon a legitimate heir to the Targaryen throne, as his birth was kept secret to protect him from Robert Baratheon’s rebellion, which sought to overthrow the Targaryen family. His full name, Aegon Targaryen, reflects his connection to this powerful and noble lineage. Thus, Jon Snow's true family line links him both to the ancient Stark house of the North and the royal Targaryen bloodline of the Seven Kingdoms.</p>
